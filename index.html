            <h1>Coffee... ?</h1>
            <p id="p1"> Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain
                Coffea species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product:
                unroasted
                green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product:
                roasted
                coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being
                filtered
                out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>

                <h1>Types of Coffee Makers</h1>
                <p id="p3">Now that you’re a master on all the coffee types, let’s learn how to make ’em! From French
                    presses to Mokas, there are plenty of ways to prepare your dream cup of java.</p>

                <div class="d1 b1">
                    <h2 id="type">French Press</h2>
                    <p>This manual coffee maker is extremely easy to use. Add ground coffee beans into your French
                        press,
                        pour piping hot water over the grounds, let the coffee steep for a few minutes and finally,
                        press
                        the plunger down and pour! Simple as that. French presses can be used for any bean, but many
                        people
                        prefer using them for darker, richer roasts. Also, how fancy does this French press look? Make
                        your
                        morning brew…in style!</p>

                    <h2>Percolator</h2>
                    <p>Try out a percolator to add a retro feel to your daily brew—like 1880s retro. To put it simply,
                        percolators brew coffee by continuously pushing boiling hot water bubbles up into the “coffee
                        chamber” . This cycle is repeated until the coffee is ready to serve.
                        They’re typically used for medium roasts and prepared over the stovetop, but percolators can
                        work
                        over any heated surface, even a campfire .</p>

                    <h2>Single Serve</h2>
                    <p>Single serve coffee maker sales have really peaked in the past few years. Measure out your
                        desired
                        coffee amount, pour into the reusable filter, pour water in and voila! A cup of coffee just for
                        you
                        will be ready soon. Single serve coffee makers are perfect for single-person households (or
                        those
                        where just one person drinks coffee). Try out this budget-friendly single serve coffee maker

                    <h2>AeroPress</h2>
                    <p>We’ve got another manual coffee maker for you. The AeroPress is very similar to the French press.
                        To
                        use an AeroPress, we recommend checking out this beautiful get-started guide. You can make
                        espresso,
                        lattes, cold brews or just a classic cup of coffee in this nifty little machine.Aeropress

                    <h2>Pour Over</h2>
                    <p>A pour-over coffee maker is exactly what it sounds like: you manually pour hot water over the
                        beans.
                        With a solid 5-star rating on Amazon, pour-over coffee makers like Chemex are a solid choice.
                        Fans
                        love the fact that you get to control the strength of the coffee, plus the pots are super easy
                        to
                        clean. You do need a special kind of filter, though, which is pricier than the typical drip
                        coffee
                        filter. However, some are reusable.</p>

                        Everyone knows about Starbucks, thanks to their aggressive marketing and shrewd advertising
                        techniques. But, does everyone like Starbucks coffee? The answer differs.

                        The brand is not known for sourcing and roasting the best coffee beans. Most of their coffee
                        beans
                        are dark roasted, meaning, they taste bitter. And many consumers, who know their coffee,
                        complain
                        that Starbucks coffee has a distinct burnt taste.

                        But that is okay with the company. The company knows what the average consumers like – caffeine.
                        And, their coffees contain a high amount of caffeine. And, Starbucks keeps coming up with
                        blended
                        and modified versions of their coffee. Thanks to regular tasting panels, the company knows just
                        how
                        much tweaking it takes to target the average consumers.

                        Plus, Starbucks gives you a lot of options to choose from. And according to its official
                        sources, it
                        does offer gourmet coffees, but that might not be the one you get from them daily.

                        Besides, the company is trying to be more eco-friendly. They are introducing more plant-based
                        meal
                        options, shifting away from single-use cups, and trying to manage their wastage better and…let's
                        hope that's the beginning of something extraordinary.</p>

                        chain with headquarters in Dunstable, England. Costa Coffee was founded in London in 1971 by
                        brothers Bruno and Sergio Costa as a wholesale operation supplying roasted coffee to caterers
                        and
                        specialist Italian coffee shops.Costa branches sell hot and cold drinks, sandwiches, cakes and
                        pastries, and snacks. In 2020, the brand collaborated with three chocolate brands (Quality
                        Street,
                        After Eight and Terry's) for some of their limited-edition Christmas drinks.[17]

                        Costa moved its roastery from Lambeth to Basildon, Essex, in May 2017 with an investment of £38
                        million, increasing their annual coffee-roasting capacity from 11,000 to 45,000 tonnes.[18]

                        In 2020 Costa Coffee canned coffee was introduced.

                        Costa Coffee employs Gennaro Pelliccia as a coffee taster, who had his tongue insured for £10m
                        with

                        Costa coffees are medium roasted, which makes them smoother, sweeter, and nuttier.</p>

                        <br>

                        Owned by McDonald's, McCafe is one of the leading coffee chains in countries like Australia and
                        New
                        Zealand. McCafé enjoys the benefit of having a vast presence (Because let's face it, McDonald's
                        is
                        everywhere!) As McDonald's expands worldwide, there is a decent chance of McCafé doing the same.

                        The coffee here, however, is freshly brewed every 30 minutes, so it is never stale. And although
                        it
                        is medium roasted, it has a bitter taste although has flavours options to add with the coffee.

                        You see, the lighter roasted coffee is, the more flavourful it tends to get. So, when having a
                        coffee at McCafé, prepare to get the nutty aftertaste.

                        Besides, the coffees are cheap <br> Reports indicated that McCafé outlets generated 15% more
                        revenue
                        than a regular McDonald's and, by 2003, were the largest coffee shop brand in Australia and New
                        Zealand.[3] After McDonald's Australia experimented with automatic espresso-pronto machines in
                        the
                        last decade and it failed to catch on, all Australian stores were subsequently renovated and
                        converted to McCafé outlets.
